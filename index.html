We can then style with CSS should we need to - and you can pick out the strong or em tags individually to style them, to.<br /> <br /> There is a break tag to create a new paragraph with a line break before this line.

        Don't forget to close out your body and HTML tags, so the browser knows this document ends, and it can render everything correctly.
